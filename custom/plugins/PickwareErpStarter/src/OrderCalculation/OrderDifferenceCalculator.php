     * calculated by subtracting the old orders and its return orders from the new order and its return orders.
     * In other words: The order difference is "what has changed" from the old order to the new order while considering
     * all return orders.

     * Not that many non-calculatable properties (e.g. customer, addresses, etc.) are not differentiated here but simply
     * kept from the new order. Any other values from the old order will be ignored in this case.
